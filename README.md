# trust_evolution

This project is inspired by [the evolution of trust](https://ncase.me/trust/) by [Nicky Case](https://ncase.me)!

The original game source material can be found [here](https://github.com/ncase/trust/#play-it-here-httpncasemetrust).


## About this project

The original game references above explores the idea of how different play tactics influence the outcome of the game of trust.

This repo is an attempt to recreate the game in `python 3.10` using `OOP`, `ABM` and the concepts shown in the game above.

This project is under active development and aims to provide the basic foundations for creating a game, where different agents can get added to it.
